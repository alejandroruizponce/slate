# Introduction

Welcome to the CheKin Tools API! 

You can use our API to access the following services:

- Police Registration Service

The CheKin Tools API is organized around REST. Our API has predictable, resource-oriented URLs, and uses HTTP response codes to indicate API errors. We use built-in HTTP features, like HTTP authentication and HTTP verbs, which are understood by off-the-shelf HTTP clients. 
We support cross-origin resource sharing, allowing you to interact securely with our API from a client-side web application. 

CheKin API accepts data as JSON or also as multipart/form-data. JSON is returned by all API responses, including errors.

The base url for CheKin Tools API endpoints is `https://api.chekin.io/api/v1/`
