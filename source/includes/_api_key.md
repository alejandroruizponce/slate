# Api Key

> To authorize, use this code:


```shell
# With shell, you can just pass the correct header with each request
curl "https://api.chekin.io/api/v1/" \
  -H "Api-Key: yourApiKeyhere"

```


> Make sure to replace `yourApiKeyhere` with your API key.

CheKin uses API keys to allow access to the API. You can ask for an new API key at soporte@chekin.io.
CheKin expects for the API key to be included in all API requests to the server in a header that looks like the following:

`Api-Key: yourApiKeyhere`

<aside class="notice">
You must replace <code>yourApiKeyhere</code> with your personal API key.
